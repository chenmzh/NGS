# Script For Annotation


  
  ### New code for Annotation and Interpretation, updated for compatibility with Sleuth Output
  
  #From today's analysis session, we received some requests for clearer code for annotation and interpretation, as well as some code to show how to extract the relevant information from the Sleuth_results() table. Here I've tried to take you through a easier path through the analysis without having to deal with the EdgeR package, which can sometimes be frustrating to work with when you have to wrangle the data in order to have compatibility (for example turning your Sleuth output into an appropriate DGEobject)
  
  # Hope this helps and best of luck with the analysis!

# let's load all the packages we will use. Make sure you have all of them installed!

# the LRT test will output p/q-vals and a test stat, in this case, it would be best to rank your genes using p-vals only

# Now that we have the list of genes after having run either the LRT or WT tests, let's clean them up, get them labelled using only EntrezIDs or SYMBOL names
# I'm just using the results_wt as an example because the b score also tells us something about the fold change:
# Let's apply str_split() from the stringr package to the target_id column (easier and faster than str_split)
results_wt$ENST <- sapply(str_split(results_wt$target_id, "\\.", n = 2), getElement, 1) # this will extract just the ENST... and also cut off the '.' at the end
results_wt$SYMBOL <- sapply(str_split(results_wt$target_id, "\\|", n = 7), getElement, 6) # we can also use the same trick to extract SYMBOL gene names (in my case, the SYMBOLS were 6th in the target_id mess of names)
# But wait, it's possible that there are still some ".x" left in the SYMBOL names. As an extra cleanup step, using the same function:
results_wt$SYMBOL <- sapply(str_split(results_wt$SYMBOL, "\\.", n = 2), getElement, 1)
# Finally, let's get EntrezIDs using AnnotationDbi
results_wt$ENTREZID <- mapIds(org.Hs.eg.db, keys = results_wt$SYMBOL, column = "ENTREZID", keytype = "SYMBOL") # In this case, we are using the SYMBOL column to obtain the ENTREZIDs, feel free to use ENST or any other
# Much better. Now we're ready to extract out of this for our Annotation and Interpretation
# For most of what you want to do in Annotation and Interpretation, you will need a RANKED list of your top and bottom genes, and a specific score (p-val is good, or the b score from Wald-test)





# Again, working with the results_lrt table, we will rank them according to p-val significance
wt_top500_pval <- results_wt[order(results_wt$pval),] %>% #ranking by ascending p-value
  select(., c(SYMBOL, ENTREZID, pval, qval, b)) %>% # we now take only the relevant columns that we want to use
  head(500)
# Now we can use this for DAVID and GO Term analysis
# For GO Term analysis using goana(), input your filtered list, along with the coefficient that you want goana() to assess (here I'm using pvalue)
dc_goanna <- goana(wt_top500_pval$ENTREZID, coef = wt_top500_pval$b, species = "Hs") # Yue will ask them tomorrow
# Now using topGO, we can see the top GO terms in your differentially expressed genes
topgo_bp <- topGO(dc_goanna,ontology = "BP")
topgo_mf <- topGO(dc_goanna,ontology = "MF")
topgo_cc <- topGO(dc_goanna,ontology = "CC")
# For DAVID Analysis you can either extract the ranked genes and simply export them into a .txt file for analysis on the DAVID webportal (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) there are few packages that will pull from the DAVID database for analysis, but the web interface is much easier. If you would like to explore using packages, check out RDAVIDWebService(http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RDAVIDWebService.html) 
# txt file for DAVID here
write.csv(wt_top500_pval$ENTREZID,file = sprintf("C:/Users/Mingzhe/Desktop/Rworkspace/old/%s.txt",contrasts),row.names = F,col.names = F,quote = F)



# Notice that the goana() analysis this time doesn't output numbers of upregulated or downregulated genes in each GO term. That's okay, it's simply a quirk of the package, as it's also been designed to work with a special output from the limma() package called a "MArrayLM" object - but this would not have been created from your Sleuth output, and to try to wrangle the output into a MArrayLM object is more trouble than it's worth. 
# HOWEVER, what you can do is to go back to your Sleuth matrix, and then rank genes based on p-value AND b score (remember that this is an estimate of log2 foldchange!) and produce a dataset of upregulated, and downregulated genes for goana() analysis!
# Now let's move on to GSEA using KEGGA and fgsea() (we will not perform any analysis using camera() as it requires the DGEObject from EdgeR)
